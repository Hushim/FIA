		<h3>About</h3>
		<p>This is the website of groupC04. We are very excited to announce that our digital image editing software FlashPhoto and the Medical analysis software MIA are finally release!</p>
		<p>Flashphoto is a photo editing software for PCs that run Unix. It features an intuitive user interface with support for opening/saving photos, undo/redo, special effects like filters, and a variety of useful and powerful editing tools. 
	    <p>MIA is a medical image analysis software which is similar to FlashPhoto. This software can be run in two modes: Graphical Mode or Command Line Mode. It also supports filters, annotation, opening/saving image. The major difference about MIA is that it features 3D imaging, reproducible and shortcuts.
